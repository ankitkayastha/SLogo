Our APIs are intended to be flexible in the addition of new GUI elements, as well as the ability to easily deal with objects.

Any time we see any errors, we will throw runtime exceptions so that the program will not crash (we might also have error boxes come up to acknowledge the fact that an error occurred).

Our APIs are good in the sense that they are flexible in areas that they need to be.  Each box within the GUI is rather rigid, since they have pretty defined uses.  However, adding a new box will be quite easy.  Also, adding any new elements to any part of the GUI should be pretty easy.

We are most excited to work on wrapping the turtle around instead of having it fly off the screen.  Also, once the back-end finally figures their problems out, we are excited to implement their commands on our screen.

Use cases:
Although everything is dependent on the parser, for now we have a few ideas.

We can try to just have the input box take in a number and move that distance forward in the display window.
