Need to make your GUI elements more flexible.  Adding new elements is somewhat hard since you are simply adding elements to each pane and then adding all of the panes onto the scene.  Make more methods in each of your pane classes so that the code is less dense.  

You should figure out how to pass the scene around so that the background can be updated.  

Even though its a factory class, use the resource file so that language can be changed.
