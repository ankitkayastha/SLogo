Part 1

1. The ability to add elements to the GUI is intended to be flexible. These elements include new options to the menus, new menu bars themselves, and other such things simialr to that. Essentially, the goal is to be able to add anything that the user wishes to create more options.

2. It encapuslates implementation decisions by being very simple and not having much interaction with the back-end. In other words, it is independent from the back-end, and theoretically, we should be able to switch out the front-ends and the program should still work.

3. If the user wants to add a new color/image and that is not handled, this will lead to an error. However, the errors that we plan on throwing include those determined by the back-end. So, errors for invalid commands, or passing incorrect parameters, etc will be determined by the back-end, but will of course be displayed by the front end.

4. I think our API/Design is good because it will allow for flexibility and adaptability for the user being ale to add components to the user interface. The goal for the user interface, even though people thik not much design goes into it, is to still make it flexible and in fact, there can be definitely an aspect of design to the front end.

Part 2

2. User chooses a new color; user loads an image from the JOptionFile; User changes pen color by inputting a new one; user clicks on a previous command/variable/pre-defined function to load it.

3. I'm most excited to work on the command history/variable workspace/user defined function area and ensuring the clikcing and loading works. It would be really cool if it's successful and if we have more time, we will try to add more features to it.

4. I'm most worrried about trying to include design patterns/design principles in the front end. I will try my best to incorporate these where we see them to be most fit.
